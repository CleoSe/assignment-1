            <h2>About the Project</h2>
            <p>
                Our project is a web application that will allow S and L garage doors more
                easily reach out to customers and plan around them. The public pages of
                the site will allow customers to learn more about the company and its
                services, while the admin pages will allow S and L employees to see and
                manage customer requests and appointments received through the site.
                Overall, the goal of the project is to improve customer engagement whilst making
                the management of customers and their requests more efficient of S and L garage doors.
